# Modern-Shopping-Cart

This is a shopping cart, a responsive web application with a modern UI, created with html, css and javascript. The user can choose between a t-shirt or a shoe pair, select the color and add the item to the cart. The items will be saved in the localStorage, so the user can refresh the browser and the items will not disappear from the shopping cart.
